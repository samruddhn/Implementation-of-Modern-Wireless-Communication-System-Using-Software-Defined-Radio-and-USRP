# Implementation-of-Modern-Wireless-Communication-System-Using-Software-Defined-Radio-and-USRP

Different modulation techniques are implemented by using GNU Radio platform and USRP B200 board. A Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a reconfigurable system that utilizes hardware and software for wireless communications. This project enables students to rapidly prototype objects by using USRP B200 board and GNU radio companion.

Under the Guidance of
